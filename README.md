- 👋 Hi, I’m Tiffany Rolle. I am a software engineer pursuing a MS in computer science. While I am building a personal portfolio, many of my projects were completed in an academic setting. Due to academic integrity standards many of my projects are set to private. If you are a potential employer would like to view my repository, I am happy to share the full repository. Please reach out to me at the e-mail below next to the mailbox icon.
- 👀 I’m interested in applied artificial intelligence, backend, and full stack software engineering projects.
- 🌱 I’m currently enrolled in a zero to mastery machine learning bootcamp on Udemy. So far I have made a lung cancer risk prediction application and used car sales prediction     application to substantiate what I have learned.
- 💞️ I’m looking to enhance my knowledge of data structures and algorithms and their real world applications. I would love to collaborate.
- 📫 How to reach me: tiffanyrolle387@gmail.com
